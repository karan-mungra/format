# Format

- Writing a simple data validation library on top already builtin data format modules like json, tomllib etc.
- This library is only for learning purpose, and right now I intention developing it for proper use cases.
- The Goal of this library is to use class decorators for data validation for different data formats.
- NOTE: This library is under heavy development.
